1) Description;
Tired of playing the countdown game? Constantly fighting robo's to get on at your time slot? Do you have nightmares about dropping the stream and the 30 listeners attached?

With TheroyRadioLogin this is all a thing of the past!

All you need to do is place TRL in your dock and as you are getting ready, run it. It will launch Nicecast and Safari to the Theory Radio site so you can log in and then pop up a message awaiting your command to take over and rock out! No more fuss no more muss!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2a) Basic Instructions;

Copy TheoryRadioLogin to your /Applications directory. It is also recommended that you put this in your dock for ease of use.
BEFORE it is your time to start launch Theory Radio Login. The application will launch Nicecast and Safari and then open the Theory Radio admin site.

!!!Log in to the admin site BEFORE you confirm the dialog box!!!!!

Once you are logged in and it is time to Start just click OK on the "Are you Ready?" dialog and it will kick the stream, start your broadcast and then refresh Safari so you can verify you are all logged in in the blink of an EYE!!!

Enjoy your show and have fun!!

2b) Source Instructions;
Source code is used so users may compile their own copies of the software for testing, adjustments or machine compatibility as needed.

Please see the source directory for the applescript and gif used for the icon. This graphic was totally stolen illegally from the Theory Radio website and and by using this you realize that. (OOPS! ;p)

To compile simply copy the code from the included txt file in to script editor or your applescript software of choice and compile to a run only application.
I also included my DMG Canvas files and graphics in case you want to distribute your version.

Please note that in my experience if you just open the TheoryRadioLogin.applescript file in Script Editor, since it is just a text file and not Apple's "script" format, it will add in several `"` on lines 37, 38 & 39 that you will have to remove to get it to compile.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mac OS X 10.3.x or higher (Tested on 10.5.6)
Safari 3 or higher (Tested with Safari 4 beta)
